# Project-Etch-a-Sketch
This is my project as part of the Odin Project's "Project: Etch-a-Sketch" assignment.

## This project will test my understanding of JavaScript, css, and html as I have covered it throughout my time with the Odin Project:
* JavaScript Data Types
* JavaScript Conditionals
* JavaScript Functions
* JavaScript DOM Manipulation
